# Credit_risk_predictor
This project implements a Credit Risk Prediction System using machine learning to estimate the probability that a borrower will fail to repay a loan. Based on the predicted default probability, the system assigns a credit score and risk rating, enabling financial institutions to assess borrower reliability and make informed lending decisions.
